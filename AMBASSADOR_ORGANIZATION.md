This document covers the organizational and operational aspects of the AsyncAPI Ambassador Program.

## FAQ

### What is the AsyncAPI Ambassador Program?

The AsyncAPI Ambassador Program aims to bring AsyncAPI closer to the users and potential users of the project. Provide users and community members with the necessary tools and resources:

- To promote cooperation between users and disseminate the necessary tools to any specification user.
- To be engaged with the project in some way, either as a contributor, blogger, speaker, etc.
- To be willing to speak at community events or write technical content, such as blog posts, solving community needs.
- To ensure that with the community’s growth, we also grow a list of people in the community that are welcoming and help spread the knowledge about the project.

### How does the program work?

- The ambassador selection process will, as always, be as transparent as possible.
- The model currently in place for adding members to the Technical Steering Committee through PR will be used.
- The TSC or their designees will evaluate applications according to the compliance with the requirements.
- All ambassador information will be added through PR to the list used to show people on the AsyncAPI website.

### Requirements to become an AsyncAPI Ambassador:

To be an official AsyncAPI ambassador, there is no more important requirement than having the desire to work and spread the message about AsyncAPI specification and tools.

- Be in tune with AsyncAPI's mission and values.
- Always respect the [code of conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Be active in your role as an ambassador.
- **Guidelines** for AsyncAPI Ambassadors: 
    The participation will be determined and checked by quarters. Understood as a minimum contribution, one of the following requirements must be met each quarter: 
    - One article on asyncapi.com or other domains. 
    - One presentation at an event or workshop. Within it, AsyncAPI should appear at the core of the presentation. The presentation would never be used as a disguised marketing tool for other products/projects.
    
    **Note**: Candidates may accumulate events or items covering subsequent quarters.
         
     Examples: 

    1. If an ambassador publishes three articles about AsyncAPI in eight months, they will be ambassadors for another quarter more.
    2. If they do a presentation at an event or workshop and write one article about AsyncAPI in 4 months, they will be ambassadors for two more quarters. 
      
         The time as an ambassador is limited to one year, and it can be renewed. 

### Benefits of being an ambassador:

- Receiving special swag for Ambassadors.
- Receiving swags for participants of the conference or workshops.
- Free entry to AsyncAPI conferences.
- Community-wide recognition.
- All our respects for your contribution!
