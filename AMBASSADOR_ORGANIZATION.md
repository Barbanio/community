This document covers the organizational and operational aspects of the AsyncAPI Ambassador Program.

## FAQ

### What is the AsyncAPI Ambassador Program?

The AsyncAPI Ambassador Program aims to bring AsyncAPI closer to both users and potential users of the project. 

The AsyncAPI Ambassador Program aims to provide users and community members with the necessary tools and resources to:

- Promote user cooperation and disseminate the necessary tools to any specific user.
- Engage with the project in some way, either as a contributor, blogger, speaker, etc.
- Speak at community events or write technical content (i.e., blog posts) that solves community needs.
- Nurture community growth and a welcoming environment to spread knowledge about the project.

### How does the program work?

- The ambassador selection process will be as transparent as possible.
- The model currently in place for adding members to the Technical Steering Committee through PR will be used.
- The TSC or delegated maintainers of community repositories will evaluate applications according to compliance requirements via a traditional PR flow.
- All ambassador information will be displayed on the AsyncAPI website in a list after the PR is merged.

### Requirements to become an AsyncAPI Ambassador:

To become an official AsyncAPI ambassador, there is no more important requirement than having the desire to work and spread the message about the AsyncAPI specification and its tools.

- Be in tune with AsyncAPI's mission and values.
- Always respect the [code of conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Be active in your role as an ambassador.
- **Guidelines** for AsyncAPI Ambassadors: 
    The participation will be determined and checked annually. The minimum requirements for being an ambassador are as follows: make **4 contributions per year** in the form of articles, talks, videos, podcasts, presentations, driving initiatives, etc.

    Some clarifications on the type of contributions:
    
    - Articles, videos, and podcasts can be published on `asyncapi.com/blog` or other domains. 
    - Talks and presentations can be displayed at different events or workshops. Within it, AsyncAPI should appear at the core of the presentation. The presentation would never be used as a disguised marketing tool for other products/projects.
    - Special contributions should be driven to support the community or enhance its visibility (i.e., getting new sponsors or driving initiatives) 
    - If we did not identify the contributions, just let us know what that was.
         
     Examples: 

    1. If contributors publishes 3 articles and propels 1 initiative about AsyncAPI in eight months, they will become ambassadors for the whole year.
    2. If contributors make 1 presentation, write 2 articles and propels 1 initiative, they will become ambassadors for the whole year.
    3. If you were accepted as ambassador on 5th of May 2022, it means you have already fulfilled the requirements. On 5th of May 2023 we will check if you did it again after 5th of May 2022.

 The time as an ambassador can be renewed annually. 

### Benefits of being an ambassador:

- Receiving special swag pack for Ambassadors (valued at $150 approx., including shipping cost).
- Receiving swags for participants of the conference or workshops (valued at $70 approx., including shipping cost).
- Free entry to AsyncAPI conferences.
- Community-wide recognition.
- All our respects for your contribution!

### Are you interested in becoming an official AsyncAPI Ambassador?

The process of becoming an ambassador is very simple. Just go to the community repository and open a PR to edit the ambassadors.json file, and TSC will evaluate your candidacy!

That PR can be created not only by the ambassador candidate, but any community member can open up a PR to submit someones application (case when community member is too shy to get on the list).

Get on board and become an ambassador!
